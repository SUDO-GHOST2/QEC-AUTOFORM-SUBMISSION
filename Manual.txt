Manual for the C++ Project: QEC Student Evaluation Form Auto Submission

Purpose

This project automates the process of logging into a university portal, navigating to the QEC feedback form, and submitting evaluations for courses.

Pre-requisites

    C++ Development Environment:
        Install a compiler like GCC or an IDE like Visual Studio.

    Libraries:
        CURL library for HTTP requests.
        Make sure CURL is installed and linked with your C++ project.
        Include the header files for curl/curl.h.

    Internet Access:
        Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

    Knowledge of Portal Login Credentials:
        You will need your username and password for the university portal.

    C++ Knowledge:
        Basic understanding of C++ programming for modifications or debugging.


Note

    Session Management:
        Always run the first student evaluation form code to log in to the main student portal thus it will save the session in cookies.txt file.
        The saved session ensures seamless access to subsequent forms and then you can fill the any form of your need.

    Form Filling:
        Once logged in, you can use the program to fill and submit the QEC Feedback Form for any available subject.

    Credentials Matching:
        The username and password used for the main student portal must match the credentials required for the QEC portal.
        If the credentials do not match, the program will fail to access and submit the QEC Feedback Form.

    Important:
        Ensure that the cookies file (cookies.txt) is not modified or deleted during the execution process to avoid session expiration or errors.
